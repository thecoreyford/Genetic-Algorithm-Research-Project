## The Fitness Function: Humans vs Computers in Music Generation

**----------Submitted around April 2018----------**

### Description
The code for a music generating genetic algorithm project, aiming to determine if a "human in the loop" fitness function is preferential to a "theory-based" counterpart. 

This is part of a 2nd Year university module, towards a BSc in Music Technology at the University of The West of England (UWE).

### Features
This project demonstrates:
* Genetic Algorithms
* JUCE (Midi, timers, data structers, gui, etc. etc. etc...)
* Basic Class Design 

... among other things.

### Notes to Students (Particularly UWE!!!!)
**You will need to reference this if you use it to avoid being accused of plagurism!**

Here is the UWE hardvard reference (or alteast how I would put the reference...)
* Ford, CF. (2018), *The Fitness Function: Humans vs Computers in Music Generation*, Project [online]. BSc, University Of The West Of England. Available from [PUT REPOSITORY LINK HERE] [PUT THE DATA ACCESSED HERE]

Furthermore, is is unlikely that directly stealing this code will actually yeild you any more marks: however, doing something similar with one of these references commented above shows you did some research and demonstarates your own skills!
