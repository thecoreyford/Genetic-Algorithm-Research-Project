## The Fitness Function: Humans vs Computers in Music Generation

**----------Submitted around April 2018----------**

### Description
The code for a music generating genetic algorithm project, aiming to determine if a "human in the loop" fitness function is preferential to a "theory-based" counterpart. 

This was part of a 2nd Year university module, towards a BSc in Music Technology at the University of The West of England.

### Features
This project demonstrates:
* Genetic Algorithms
* JUCE (Midi, timers, data structs, gui, etc. etc. etc...)
* Basic Class Design 

... among other things.
